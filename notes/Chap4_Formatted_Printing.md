Exercise 2
= 
Formatted Printing

The Target
= 
* Learn to use printf command

Code
= 

The Analysis
= 
Break down the code:

    1. first, we'are including another header file called **stdio.h**. This tells the compiler that we'are going to use the standard Input/Output functions --> printf
    2. Then you're using a variable named *age* and settings it to 10.
    3. Next you're using a variable *height* and setting it to 72.
    4. Then we use the printf function to print the age and height
    5. In the *prinft* we passed in a string
    6. After this format string, we put the variables that should be replaced into the format string by printf.
